The challenge was to "touch grass" in the game, but an "Invisible Barrier" (note the quote marks we'll get back to this) prevented me from touching the grass.  Like most Capture-the-Flags, i thought "of course its not that simple".

I found a dog merchant selling an image of a flag that was "sold out", and another dog merchant who did "Pixelize as a Service" to pixelize images, I put two and two together, downloaded the flag image and uploaded it to the Pixelize as a Service, and the Invisible Barrier was no longer there!  I had "Solved the Challenge"

The "Invisible Barrier" mentioned was actually just in game lag.  There was no challenge, but this provided context to me for when I attemped the "Pixelize as a Service" challenge.
