This challenge was part of the Skateboarding Dog 2025 game.  I solved it after the event had closed while I was just having fun in the game.

## Solve
One area of the game presented a long string of flags on the screen, each flag with a letter.  At first i thought it would be some sort of code, but then I realised they were actually spelling out the beginning of a flag to be submitted.

To solve this, I opened the Network tab in the Developer Tools and refreshed the page, I expected to find an image of the full set of flags containing the full code.  I was close, but each flag was its own image being requested, and they were numbered in order.  So solving this was as simple as writing down each letter.
