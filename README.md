# CTF Writeups

This repository is for my Capture The Flag (CTF) Writeups.  I am not an expert - the goal is to **document my thought processes**, see where I went wrong (or right!), and improve my skills in the process.

Rather then a showcase of perfect solves, this is more of a learning journal, and I hope one day it helps someone facing similar problems as me.
